A modular and extensible framework for implementing **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve forward and inverse problems involving ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). This repository serves as a foundational codebase for exploring Scientific Machine Learning (SciML).

## 📖 Introduction

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process of a deep neural network. By using automatic differentiation to calculate derivatives, the network is trained to satisfy the differential equations, initial conditions, and boundary conditions simultaneously. This approach is powerful for solving problems where data is sparse but the physical model is known.

This framework provides a structured implementation to easily experiment with different PDEs, boundary conditions, and network architectures.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Separate, reusable components for data generation, network building, loss computation, and training.
- **Multiple PDE Examples**: Includes implementations for classic equations like:
  - The Allen-Cahn Equation
  - The Burgers' Equation
  - The Heat Equation
  - The Wave Equation
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configurable parameters, boundary conditions, and network hyperparameters.
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Tools for plotting results, comparing solutions, and analyzing loss convergence and PDE residual.
- **Inverse Problem Support**: Framework can be extended to solve inverse problems (parameter discovery).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Core Framework**: TensorFlow 2.x / Keras (for automatic differentiation)
- **Scientific Computing**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interactive Development**: Jupyter Notebook
